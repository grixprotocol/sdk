## Trading Integration Examples

### Market Analysis Workflow

```typescript
// 1. Get market indicators for trend analysis
const indicators = await getTradingIndicators({
  exchange: 'binance',
  symbol: 'BTC/USDT',
  interval: '1h',
});

// 2. Generate trading signals based on market conditions
const signals = await generateSignals({
  assets: ['BTC'],
  budget: '5000',
  userPrompt: 'Generate moderate growth strategies',
});

// 3. Get price predictions for confirmation
const prediction = await getAssetPricePredictions({
  asset: 'BTC',
  timeframe: '8h',
});
```

### Perpetual Futures Trading Workflow

```typescript
// 1. Check current market conditions
const fundingRate = await getCurrentFundingRate({
  protocol: 'hyperliquid',
  pair: 'BTC-USD',
});

// 2. Analyze predicted funding for opportunity optimization
const predictedFunding = await getPerpsPredictedFundings({
  protocol: 'hyperliquid',
});

// 3. Monitor trading fees for cost management
const tradingFee = await getTradingFee({
  protocol: 'hyperliquid',
});
```
